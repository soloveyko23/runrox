						<h3>Informational and Educational Purposes Only</h3>
						<p>RunRox and the tools provided do NOT offer or provide personalized investment advice. The tools, scanners, data, content, and information offered are impersonal and not customized to meet the investment needs of any individual. As such, the tools, scanners, data, content, and information are provided solely for informational and educational purposes only.

						<h3>Site Disclaimer</h3>
						<p>By viewing any material or using the information within this Site, you agree that this is general education material, and you will not hold any person or entity responsible for loss or damages resulting from the content or general information provided by runrox.com. This Site cannot accept responsibility for any errors or omissions to the accuracy of information contained on this Site.

						<h3>Indemnity</h3>
						<p>You agree to indemnify and hold RunRox and our subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees, partners and licensors harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of content you submit, post, transmit, modify or otherwise make available through the RunRox services, your use of the RunRox services, your connection to theRunRox services, your violation of the Terms of Use, or your violation of any rights of another.</p>

						<h3>Disclaimer regarding investment decisions and trading</h3>
						<p>Decisions to buy, sell, hold or trade in securities, commodities and other investments involve risk and are best made based on the advice of qualified financial professionals. Any trading in securities or other investments involves a risk of substantial losses. The practice of "Day Trading" involves particularly high risks and can cause you to lose substantial sums of money. Before undertaking any trading program, you should consult a qualified financial professional. Please consider carefully whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your financial condition and ability to bear financial risks. Under no circumstances shall we be liable for any loss or damage you or anyone else incurs as a result of any trading or investment activity that you or anyone else engages in based on any information or material you receive through RunRox or our services.</p>

						<h3>Disclaimer regarding hypothetical performance results</h3>
						<p>Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are mentioned below. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program.</p>
						<p>One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. For example the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of the trading losses are material points, which can also adversely affect trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the market in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.</p>

						<h3>Payment and cancellation of service</h3>
						<p>By ordering any subscription on runrox.com you confirm that you have read and accepted our Terms of Use and you authorize RunRox to automatically charge your bank card or PayPal account according to the billing period manually selected by you.</p>
						<p>Each user can try any paid plan 7 days with a guarantee of refund. If the trial is not cancelled before its expiration date, it automatically converts to a monthly Quarterly, or annual paid plan depending on user's choice. There are no refunds for monthly or Quarterly Plans, even if the subscription is canceled on the same day as the autoconversion payment has gone through. Refunds are available only after an automatic deduction for annual payments (i.e. after trial and after renewal) within 14 calendar days after the payment was made. Please note that users who filed a chargeback/dispute request or a claim are not eligible for a refund. A cancelled trial and associated services will stop immediately after cancellation, except for any data packages that were purchased.</p>
						<p>The service is billed in advance on a monthly, annual, or 2-year basis. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, or refunds for months unused with an open user account. If auto renewal fails for an annual plan you will automatically be switched to a monthly plan.</p>
						<p>All billing is recurring, which means you will continue to get billed until you cancel your subscription. You are solely responsible for properly canceling your RunRox subscription. An email request or support ticket asking for your subscription to be cancelled is not considered cancellation. You may cancel your subscription at any time by visiting the billing section of your Profile Settings page.</p>
						<p>If you cancel the service before the end of your current paid up period, your subscription will remain active until the next due date. After the due date, if no payment received, your subscription will be stopped.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>We do not offer refunds for initial payments. If you order the service for the first time, please make sure that the order is correct before the payment is made.</li>
							<li>We do not offer refunds for recurring monthly payments. If you have been billed for automatic monthly renewal of the Service, you can cancel the subscription to avoid billing for next months.</li>
							<li>We do not offer refunds for upgrades to a more expensive plan or a longer billing cycle. Remaining days are converted into an equivalent value of days on the new subscription.</li>
							<li>We offer refunds for recurring annual and 2-year payments on demand. If you have been billed for automatic annual and 2-year renewal of the service, you have 14 calendar days (after the payment was made) to contact our support team. If you don't do this, RunRox assumes that renewal of the service is expected and the payment will not be refunded.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Refunds are available only after an automatic deduction for annual payments (i.e. after trial and after renewal) within 14 calendar days after the payment was made.</p>
						<p>Our moderators are official RunRox representatives, with the authority to warn or ban users (including those with a paid subscription) when they do not abide by the House Rules. We do not offer refunds in case you are banned from publishing content and interacting with others because your paid subscription and all of its data and/or features are still available during any such ban.</p>
