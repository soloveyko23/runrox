						<h1>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a purchase from runrox.com (the "Site").</h1>
						<p>By using this website (runrox.com) you agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy as listed below.</p>

						<h3>Personal Information we collect:</h3>
						<p>When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device.

						<ul>
							<li>"Cookies" are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.</li>

						<p>When we talk about "Personal Information" in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Order Information.</p>

						<p>We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).</p>

						<h3>Sharing you personal Information</h3>

						<p>Additionally, please note that your information will be transferred outside of Europe, including to Canada and the United States.</p>
